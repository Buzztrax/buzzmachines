* PORTAMENTO TIME SLIDER
by: Cameron Bonde

* SAMPLE DIRECTION SLIDER (?)
by: Cameron Bonde

* ATTACK TIME SLIDER
by: Void

* EASY PLAY REVERSED
by: Cameron Bonde
parameter = offset

* Keep the "gate" open a bit longer to avoid clicks in the effects after matilde tracker

---- complex ----

* BUG FIX AGAINST MC-1
by: Cameron Bonde
Do not use wave 0 as default, use wave 1 instead (it's probably un-initialized data somewhere in the code)

* MIDI RECORD
by: CyanPhase
perhaps it should support both quantized and un-quantized mode (using sample delay ED command)
