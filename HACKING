= Filenames =
Linux has case-sensitive filenames. Rename all *.CPP .H files to lowercase
extensions.

= Includes =
replace any include for machineinterface.h with this
#include <MachineInterface.h>

replace any #include <windows.h> with
#include <windef.h>

= Misc =
* Matilde/Tracker is a example of how to build various variants of the same code
  (mono/stereo)
* if the machine has UI, don't rip it out, use #ifdef HAVE_WIN32_UI, maybe we
  can do something useful in the future
