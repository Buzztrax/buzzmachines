= Filenames =
Linux has case-sensitive filenames. Rename all *.CPP .H files to lowercase
extensions. If the machine consist of a single cpp file, its a good idea to make
it match the machine name.

= Intermediate Files =
- don't add Release/Debug folders from windows source snapshots.
- don't add those
  unnecessary Visual Studio files:
  *.aps, *.clw, *.ncb, *.opt, *.plg
  intermediate files:
  *.obj, *.pch, *.exp, *.sbr, *.bsc, *.ilk, *.lib, *.pdb, *.res, *.idb

= Build =
- copy Makefile.am from a ported machine, changed names in the file.
- add a Makefile.am for the machine author if not yet there
- edit configure.ac, go to bottom and add the newly created Makefiles
- if the port is not fully done, don't add the machine dir the the SUBDIRS var
  in the Makefile.am on level up. One can still enter the dir directly and run
  make

= Includes =
replace any include for machineinterface.h with this
#include <MachineInterface.h>

replace any #include <windows.h> with
#include <windef.h>

= Misc =
* Matilde/Tracker is a example of how to build various variants of the same code
  (mono/stereo)
* if the machine has UI, don't rip it out, use #ifdef HAVE_WIN32_UI, maybe we
  can do something useful in the future
 
= Testing =
check if the plugin can be loaded:
~/projects/buzztard/bml/src/bmltest_info ./.libs/libFSM_Kick.so

test for memory leaks:
GLIBCPP_FORCE_NEW=1 GLIBCXX_FORCE_NEW=1 valgrind --tool=memcheck --leak-check=full --leak-resolution=high --trace-children=yes --num-callers=20 -v ~/projects/buzztard/bml/src/bmltest_info ./.libs/libFSM_Kick.so
