= Porting =

Below is a list of unported machines. Please remove them from the list when its
ported and add them to the list, when you received source for a machine.
We have a page on the wiki where the efforts of obtaining machines sources are
listed (http://wiki.buzztard.org/index.php/BuzzMachineSources).

Arguru (never released as buzzmachines)
  Compressor
  Distortion
  GoaSlider
Fuzzpilz
  UnwieldyTracker
Ld
  Gate (builds, but needs auxbus)

= Filenames =
Linux has case-sensitive filenames. Rename all *.CPP .H files to lowercase
extensions. If the machine consists of a single cpp file, its a good idea to
make it match the machine name.

Also avoid spaces in file names (this is a limitation of the build system). Use
underscore characters ('_') instead.

Be careful when editing the file though and please keep them in WINDOWS-1252 
char format.


= Intermediate Files =
- don't add Release/Debug folders from windows source snapshots.
- don't add those
  unnecessary Visual Studio files:
  *.aps, *.clw, *.ncb, *.opt, *.plg
  intermediate files:
  *.obj, *.pch, *.exp, *.sbr, *.bsc, *.ilk, *.lib, *.pdb, *.res, *.idb


= Build =
- enter then machine dir (e.g. cd Ensonic/CallbackTester)
- run ../../gen_makefile_am.sh and check the resulting Makefile.am
- add a Makefile.am for the machine author if not yet there
- edit configure.ac, go to bottom and add the newly created Makefiles
- if the port is not fully done, don't add the machine dir the the SUBDIRS var
  in the Makefile.am on level up. One can still enter the dir directly and run
  make


= Includes =
- replace any include for MachineInterface.h that uses a path with this
#include <MachineInterface.h>
- likewise include other subsystems from common as
#include <mdk/mdk.h>
#include <auxbus/auxbus.h>
- replace any #include <windows.h> with
#include <windef.h>


= Compiler Warnings/Errors =
error: ‘__min’ was not declared in this scope
-> #include <windef.h>

error: name lookup of ‘c’ changed for new ISO ‘for’ scoping
error:   using obsolete binding at ‘c’
-> move "int c" out of the for-loop

error: dereferencing type-punned pointer will break strict-aliasing rules
- often used for bitacess of floats
  can be fixed using unions as in MadBrain/4fm2f/4fm2f.cpp in float_as_bits
- zero-check *(int*)&float_var -> float_var!=0.0


= Extra files (demo-songs, presets and help) =
Preset and Help files need to follow the pattern Author_Machine.extension. For
presets the extension is prs, for help files it can be txt,htm and html (all
lowercase).

* Preset file:
  * FSM/Infector
  * MadBrain Dynamite6
* Help file:
  * CyanPhase/DTMF-1
  * Elenzil Modulator
  * FrequencyUnknown ODelay
  * Matilde/Tracker
* Demo song:
  * Elenzil Modulator
  * FrequencyUnknown ODelay
  * FSM/Infector
  * MadBrain Dynamite6
  * Zwar 11Stereo
  * Zwar Csi

= Misc =
* Matilde/Tracker is an example of how to build various variants of the same code
  (mono/stereo and 2 api versions)

= Portability =
* if the machine has UI, don't rip it out, use #ifdef HAVE_WIN32_UI, maybe we
  can do something useful in the future
* whenever there is something windows specific that is not easily made portable,
  it would be good to wrap it with a #ifdef WIN32
* replace uses of MessageBox by pCB->MessageBox and strip extra args

= Testing =
check if the plugin can be loaded:
~/projects/buzztard/bml/src/bmltest_info ./.libs/libFSM_Kick.so

try to process
~/projects/buzztard/bml/src/bmltest_process ./.libs/libJeskola_Trilok.so $HOME/projects/buzztard/bml/src/input.raw $HOME/projects/buzztard/bml/src/output.raw

test for memory leaks:
GLIBCPP_FORCE_NEW=1 GLIBCXX_FORCE_NEW=1 valgrind --tool=memcheck --leak-check=full --leak-resolution=high --trace-children=yes --num-callers=20 -v ~/projects/buzztard/bml/src/bmltest_info ./.libs/libFSM_Kick.so


= make a source snapshot (including uncommitted files) =
cd ..
zip -r buzzmachines.zip buzzmachines -x@buzzmachines/exclude.lst
