= Filenames =
Linux has case-sensitive filenames. Rename all *.CPP .H files to lowercase
extensions. If the machine consist of a single cpp file, its a good idea to make
it match the machine name.

= Intermediate Files =
- don't add Release/Debug folders from windows source snapshots.
- don't add those
  unnecessary Visual Studio files:
  *.aps, *.clw, *.ncb, *.opt, *.plg
  intermediate files:
  *.obj, *.pch, *.exp, *.sbr, *.bsc, *.ilk, *.lib, *.pdb, *.res, *.idb

= Build =
- enter then machine dir
- run ../../gen_makefile_am.sh and check the resulting Makefile.am
- add a Makefile.am for the machine author if not yet there
- edit configure.ac, go to bottom and add the newly created Makefiles
- if the port is not fully done, don't add the machine dir the the SUBDIRS var
  in the Makefile.am on level up. One can still enter the dir directly and run
  make

= Includes =
- replace any include for MachineInterface.h that uses a path with this
#include <MachineInterface.h>
- replace any #include <windows.h> with
#include <windef.h>

= Misc =
* Matilde/Tracker is an example of how to build various variants of the same code
  (mono/stereo and 2 api versions)
* FSM/Infector ships a preset file and a demo song

= Portability =
* if the machine has UI, don't rip it out, use #ifdef HAVE_WIN32_UI, maybe we
  can do something useful in the future
* whenever there is something windows specific that is not easily made portable,
  it would be good to wrapp it with a #ifdef WIN32
 
= Testing =
check if the plugin can be loaded:
~/projects/buzztard/bml/src/bmltest_info ./.libs/libFSM_Kick.so

try to process
~/projects/buzztard/bml/src/bmltest_process ./.libs/libJeskola_Trilok.so $HOME/projects/buzztard/bml/src/input.raw $HOME/projects/buzztard/bml/src/output.raw

test for memory leaks:
GLIBCPP_FORCE_NEW=1 GLIBCXX_FORCE_NEW=1 valgrind --tool=memcheck --leak-check=full --leak-resolution=high --trace-children=yes --num-callers=20 -v ~/projects/buzztard/bml/src/bmltest_info ./.libs/libFSM_Kick.so
