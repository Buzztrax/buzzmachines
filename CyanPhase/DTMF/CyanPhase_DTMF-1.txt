CyanPhase DTMF-1

Version 1.2 - Fixed clicking with analog A-R envelope

My most useful generator yet!..

NEW_ATOM really wanted this type of generator so... anyway
this is a DTMF generator, which means that buzz can sound
like a telephone. So you don't need cooledit to make them
for you :P. the first column allows you to enter the
numbers


This machine comes also with the source code, it demonstrates
how easy it is to calculate and use fast sine coefficients
to generate nice sine waves without a using a buffer or
wavetable.
