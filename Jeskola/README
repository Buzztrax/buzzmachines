= Bass/Bass2/Bass3 =
All needed waveforms are in the OscTable.

== Bass ==
global filter
waveform: 1=saw/2=pulse/3=triangle
no describe function (we could add it)

== Bass 2 ==
filter per track
waveform: 0=sine/1=saw/2=pulse/3=triangle/4=noise

== Bass 3 ==
filter per track
waveform: 0=sine/1=saw/2=pulse/3=triangle/4=noise/5=tb303sawtooth
