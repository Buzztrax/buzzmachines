	I am willing to donate the source code of my Buzz effects and synths (previously unreleased), if you agree to 
	 
	1) accept the GPL for my code 
	1) try to make good use of the code 
	2) credit me somewhere if it becomes useful to the project 
	 
	I will provide the source under the GPL.  
	 
	I might help you with you work on the code, but my time is limited so I can't promise much.

	Please find here-attached the complete set of my plugins, some were unreleased until
	now and are in beta and/or broken state, but the most popular ones are in good shape.
	I don't have much time to actively assist you in the porting, but I will try to answer
	any inquiry you might have on the plugins and their internals.

	...

	the backup snapshot I am attaching is dated 2000-10-04 so everything must be in there.
