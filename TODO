* libtool
** avoid lib prefix
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/automake/2004-05/msg00016.html
http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual.html#Makefile-rules
** avoid to install *.la files

* docs
** install docs: $prefix/share/Gear/<plugin>.(txt,html)
** this would not work with BML_PATH
*** maybe support a combination of $prefix (for native machines)
*** and BML_PATH for win32 dlls (so that people can point t to their mounted
    buzz dir)
** use asciidocs for docs?
