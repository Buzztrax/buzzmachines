= Testing the buzzmachine loader =
These machines are not build by default. If you want to work on the buzzmachine
loader, you can cd here and run make to build them. These machines are neutral
to the sounds, but log the host api calls. This way one can build them natively
and for win32 using visual studio and compare the api invocations.
